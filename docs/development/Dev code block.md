# webpack-remove-block-loader

The `webpack-remove-block-loader` is Webpack loader to strip blocks of code marked by special comment tags. Useful for removing code that you don't want in your production webpack bundle (e.g. verbose console warnings, etc).

Example: the code in side `/* PrdDeletion:start */` and `/* PrdDeletion:end */` will be removed in PRD bundle.

```javascript
  /* devblock:start */
  console.log(`base URL is ${base}`);
  /* devblock:end */
}
```
