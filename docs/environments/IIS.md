# IIS Support

The `Web.config` file in **sm-react-iis** had been added for IIS hosting purpose. This file should be copy along with all files in dist folder when hosting in IIS.

However if you are not hosting this app in IIS just simply remove the submodule **sm-react-iis** There is no impact to the application.
